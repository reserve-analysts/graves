<span style="color:#c0392b">**_Graves & Company Consulting LLC_**</span> was founded in 2017 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Graves & Co., a transactional advisory service and support company to the upstream oil and gas industry founded in 1996 by John L Graves.  The Consulting company was founded to formally provide those services that had been provided by Graves & Co. throughout its 21 years of history as part of its evaluation of various oil and gas assets on behalf of client companies.

The parent company had provided due diligence analysis of basic industry concerns for clients in the acquisition of over US$275 Million in properties throughout the United States, but also expertise on over US$4 Billion in asset evaluations.  Included in much of this effort had been third party services of reservoir engineering and geological analyses.

Founded in May 1996 by John L. Graves, Graves & Co. provides transaction advisory, service and support to the upstream oil and gas industry.  The firm has a predominant buy-side focus, and assists clients in the acquisition of producing properties, in negotiating and documenting exploration joint ventures and drilling deals, and in conducting due diligence for lenders.  Over the last two years, Graves & Co. has expanded its services to include oilfield service sector research and analysis, and acquisition services.

Beginning in mid-2017 the John Graves took the opportunity to form the reserve evaluation company to provide technical services directly to client companies needing independent evaluation of oil and gas assets for various purposes, as well as part of the parent company’s due diligence analysis during asset reviews for acquisition.  Several qualified reservoir engineers and geologists are associates of the company and will provide technical expertise in conventional and unconventional plays, in both domestic and international areas of interest.
